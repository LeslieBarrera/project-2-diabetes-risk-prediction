# project-2-diabetes-risk-prediction

## Proposal 
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that will be able to predict an individualâ€™s likelihood of having diabetes, and categorize them into three different categories of risk: Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk. By identifying risk levels, the model will be able to provide insights for healthcare providers, helping to ensure intervention measures can be taken appropriately, and resources can be allocated to individuals with High Risk levels.

## Goal 
To build a machine learning model to predict weather a patient has diabetes 

### Step One - Exploratory Data Analysis 
### Step Two - Data Proprocessing 
### Step Three - Clearly Defining Risk Categories 
### Step Four - Developing the Model 
### Step Five - Model Evaluation
