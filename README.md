# project-2-diabetes-risk-prediction

## Proposal 
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that will be able to predict an individualâ€™s likelihood of having diabetes, and categorize them into three different categories of risk: Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk. By identifying risk levels, the model will be able to provide insights for healthcare providers, helping to ensure intervention measures can be taken appropriately, and resources can be allocated to individuals with High Risk levels.

## Goal 
To build a machine learning model to predict weather a patient has diabetes (Target Column: Diabetes). The model will provide insights into which features are most influential in the prediction. 

## Dataset 

The dataset we used was sourced from Kaggle, comprising over 250,000 records and 23 features. These features include information like BMI, physical activity, smoking habits, and more, which are crucial in understanding and predicting diabetes risks. The target variable categorizes individuals into three groups: no diabetes (0), pre-diabetes (1), and diabetes (2)

## 4 Research Questions

In the process of developing our model, we aimed to answer 4 research questions along the way.
1. Can survey questions from the BRFSS provide accurate predictions of whether an individual has diabetes?
2. What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes risk?
3. Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes?
4. Can we create a short form of questions from the BRFSS using feature selection to accurately predict if someone might have diabetes or is at high risk of diabetes?

## Project Steps 

### Step One - Exploratory Data Analysis 
### Step Two - Data Proprocessing 
### Step Three - Clearly Defining Risk Categories 
### Step Four - Developing the Model 
### Step Five - Model Evaluation
